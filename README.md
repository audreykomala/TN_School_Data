I followed the above site to see if there was a correlation between school rating, and the number of students that were enrolled in free/reduced lunches.

I noticed that there was a negative correlation between the two. As school ratings lowered, the number of students that had free/reduced lunches increased.
I decided to look at how public schools are funded. I found that public schools are mostly funded by property tax, which provides around 50% of total education revenue. 

We can assume that schools with a higher percentage of students on free/reduced lunches means that the family of said students are lower income. These lower income familes depend on the state to help provide their children with meals that they might not be able to provide. Since public schools are funded by property taxes, neighborhoods with lower income families will collect less proporty tax since their houses hold less value. Less funding means that schools have a higher student to teacher ratio. These schools also have less resources, which includes mental and emotional support for students, and newer learning material. Less resources and funding can account for the low school rating among these schools.

From the last graph, we can see that there is a positive correlation between percent of students that are black/hispanic and the percent of students enrolled in free/reduced lunches.
